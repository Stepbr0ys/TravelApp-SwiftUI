# TravelApp-SwiftUI

Hi All👋🏻
A couple of days ago I found this cool design and I wanted to replicate it on SwiftUI 🌱
All animations are created by me. This time they had difficulties working with ScrollView 😣
The work was done based on the work from the courses that I showed in previous posts. It was interesting to test myself after training, I am very pleased with the result 🏔
Design by: Vadim Marchenko 💪
